    help
        HTTP endpoint used by the ESP32 device to fetch synthesized speech.
        The proxy is recommended to run on your LAN and handle Qwen/DashScope
        credentials server-side for better maintainability.

        Example:
          http://192.168.1.10:8000/tts

config CLOUD_CHAT_PROXY_URL
    string "Cloud Chat proxy URL"
    default ""
    help
        HTTP endpoint used by the ESP32 device to upload user audio and get
        assistant speech back (audio/wav).

        Example:

config CLOUD_CHAT_PCM_PROXY_URL
    string "Cloud Chat PCM stream URL (low latency)"
    default ""
    help
        Optional low-latency endpoint. The ESP32 uploads user audio (audio/wav),
        and the server responds with streaming 16-bit PCM (audio/L16) so the
        device can play while the assistant is still synthesizing.

        Example:
          http://192.168.1.10:8000/chat_pcm

    default 450
    help
